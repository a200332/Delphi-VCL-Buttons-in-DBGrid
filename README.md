There has been a trend for cloud based applications to show the Delete and Edit
buttons in the grid. So a quick search on the net revealed that very little
information on how to create a Styled Working Button in a Standard VCL DBGrid.
So here is a development prototype that could be implemented in your
application.

How should this Styled Button appear and function in the DBGrid:-

-   Must be visible but inactive in state on all non- focused rows of the
    DBGrid.

-   Also focused when the row is focused.

-   Become a fully functional standard button i.e. makes uses all button events.

Take a look at how the buttons are seamlessly integrated in the DBGrid below.
Then read on how to quickly implement this in to your DBGrid.
